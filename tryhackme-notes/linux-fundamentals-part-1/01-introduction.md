# 01 - Introduction to Linux

## What is Linux?

Linux is an open-source operating system based on Unix. It's widely used in servers, cybersecurity labs, and even in embedded systems like routers or IoT devices. For ethical hackers, knowing Linux is a must — most hacking tools are built to run on Linux, and many real-world environments are Linux-based.

Linux comes in different distributions (called "distros") like Ubuntu, Debian, Kali, Fedora, etc. Each distro has its own flavor, but the core functionality and structure are generally the same.

## Why is Linux Important in Ethical Hacking?

- Most hacking tools are designed for Linux.
- Servers and target machines often run Linux.
- It's powerful for automation, scripting, and managing systems.
- It gives you more control over the system compared to Windows.

If you’re serious about ethical hacking or cybersecurity, Linux is something you’ll be using every day.

## Terminal & Shell

The **terminal** is a command-line interface (CLI) where we interact with the Linux system by typing commands. The shell interprets those commands. The most common shell is **bash** (Bourne Again SHell), but there are others like zsh or sh.

Instead of clicking through menus, you use commands like:

```bash
ls       # List files in a directory
cd       # Change directory
pwd      # Print working directory
