# Task 3: Interacting With Your First Linux Machine (In-Browser)

## What This Task Covers

This task introduces the TryHackMe in-browser Linux machine. It gives you hands-on experience interacting with a real Linux environment using the terminal — directly from your browser.

You don’t need to install anything locally. The goal is to get comfortable with typing commands and seeing how the system responds.

## Accessing the Machine

To start the machine:

1. Click the green **"Start Machine"** button.
2. A terminal window will appear on the right side.
3. Wait a few seconds until it fully boots.

This machine runs a basic Linux environment, and you’ll use the terminal to interact with it.

---

## What You’ll Practice

- Typing commands directly into the terminal
- Observing how Linux responds
- Navigating the environment using CLI (Command Line Interface)

Example:
```bash
whoami

This command returns the current user you're logged in as.

pwd

This shows your current directory (your location in the file system).

These commands will be explained more deeply in the next task, but this section is all about getting used to the feel of the terminal.
Terminal Tips

    Commands are case-sensitive: LS ≠ ls

    You can use the up arrow to bring back previous commands

    Press Tab to auto-complete file or folder names

    If you make a typo, use the left/right arrows to move the cursor

My Notes

This was my first time using a Linux machine through the browser. At first, it felt a bit weird not clicking around like on Windows, but it makes sense for hacking and server work. It’s faster and gives more control. I can already see how important the terminal is going to be for everything that follows.
