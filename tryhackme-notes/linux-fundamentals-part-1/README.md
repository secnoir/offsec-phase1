# Linux Fundamentals Part 1 — TryHackMe Notes

These are my personal notes from the **Linux Fundamentals Part 1** room on TryHackMe. I'm currently learning ethical hacking, and building a strong foundation in Linux is one of my first goals.

This room helped me understand the basic structure and functionality of Linux systems — something that’s essential for any aspiring ethical hacker. The notes here are written in my own words as I went through the tasks.

## What's Covered

Here’s a quick overview of what the room goes through:

- Intro to Linux and the command line
- Navigating the Linux file system
- Understanding file and directory permissions
- Viewing and editing files
- Basic command-line tools and utilities

## Why I’m Taking Notes

I'm using TryHackMe as my main learning platform right now, and I wanted a way to keep track of what I’ve learned and understood. Writing these notes helps me:

- Remember key concepts
- Build a habit of documenting my progress
- Create a reference I can use later in more advanced rooms

## Folder Structure

Each markdown file in this folder represents a section or key topic from the room. I tried to break things down in a simple way that I can understand when I come back to review.
