# Task 2: A Bit of Background on Linux

## What is Linux?

Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system that's commonly used on servers, desktops, embedded systems, and mobile devices. It was created by **Linus Torvalds** in 1991 and has become a major part of the tech world, especially in security and networking.

Instead of being a single OS, Linux comes in many different versions, called **distributions** (or "distros"). Each one includes the Linux kernel plus software packages.

## Popular Linux Distributions

Some commonly used Linux distributions:

- **Ubuntu** – beginner-friendly and widely supported
- **Debian** – stable and widely used as a base for other distros
- **Kali Linux** – used in penetration testing and ethical hacking
- **Arch Linux** – minimalist and customizable
- **Fedora** – cutting-edge features with regular updates

Each distro is suited for different use cases, but they all use the same Linux foundation.

## Why is Linux Important in Cybersecurity?

- Most security tools are built for Linux (like `nmap`, `netcat`, `hydra`, etc.)
- Many target machines (like web servers) run Linux
- Terminal-based control gives more flexibility and speed
- Understanding Linux is critical for post-exploitation and privilege escalation

Whether you're doing CTFs, bug bounties, or real-world pentesting, you're almost guaranteed to work in a Linux environment.

## My Notes

Before this, I thought Linux was just for programmers. But now I understand it's a powerful OS used in everything from web servers to hacking labs. As someone learning ethical hacking, getting comfortable with Linux is clearly one of the first and most important steps.
